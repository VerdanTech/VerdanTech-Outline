# The Plant Feature Category

The Plant feature category allows the creation of Plants, which are representations of physical plant instances that exist at some place in space and time. Plants derive attributes from a Cultivar.

SeedPackets are used to track the inventory of seeds available for being turned into Plants. This allows constraining Agroplan optimization with seed supply.
