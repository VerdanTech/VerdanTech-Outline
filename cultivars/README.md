# The Cultivars Feature Category

The Cultivars feature category allows the creation of Cultivars and CultivarSets. Cultivars are containers for a set of PlantAttributeProfiles, which are datastructures that specify the behavior of different plant species among different categories. CultivarSets collect a set of references to Cultivars, allowing Gardens, Users, and other models to maintain a collection of attributes for determining plant attributes.
